## Methodological Innovation

This package represents the **first comprehensive implementation** of machine learning methods specifically designed for STC analysis.

- **Subgroup identification**: Discover patient subgroups with differential treatment responses
- **Precision medicine**: Support personalized treatment decisions based on patient characteristics

### Robust Causal Inference
- **Doubly robust methods**: Protection against model misspecification in either propensity score or outcome models
- **Cross-fitting**: Reduce overfitting bias through sample splitting techniques
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Provide valid confidence intervals under weaker assumptions

### Advanced Modeling Capabilities
- **Non-linear relationships**: Capture complex interactions between covariates and outcomes
- **High-dimensional data**: Handle scenarios with many covariates relative to sample size
- **Deep learning integration**: Leverage neural networks for complex confounding patterns
