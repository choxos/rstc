# Comprehensive R Package for Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC)

A complete R package for conducting simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis with integrated reporting capabilities. This package supports both anchored and unanchored STC methodologies with beautiful HTML report generation.

## Overview

Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) is a statistical methodology for indirect treatment comparisons:

- **Anchored STC**: Comparisons with a shared control arm between studies
- **Unanchored STC**: Comparisons between single-arm studies without shared control

## Package Structure

### Advanced Methodologies (Develop Branch)

#### NORTA Unanchored STC
**Location**: `advanced_methods/NORTA_uSTC/`

Implementation of the NORTA (NORmal To Anything) algorithm for unanchored STC with correlated binary covariates, based on Ren et al. (2023).

**Key Features:**
- Uses Normal copula for generating correlated binary variables
- Preserves both marginal distributions and correlation structure
- Bootstrap uncertainty quantification
- Comprehensive validation tools

**Files:**
- `norta_ustc_analysis.R` - Core NORTA STC functions
- `example_norta_ustc_analysis.Rmd` & `example_norta_ustc_analysis.R` - Comprehensive examples

#### Multivariate Normal Simulation STC
**Location**: `advanced_methods/MVN_simulation_STC/`

Implementation of non-linear STC methodology based on Ishak et al. (2015) that addresses the fundamental bias problem in traditional STC methods.

**Key Innovation:**
- Addresses the mathematical issue that f(E[X]) â‰  E[f(X)] for non-linear functions
- Samples individual patient profiles from multivariate normal distribution
- Provides bias-free estimates for non-linear outcomes

**Applications:**
- Survival analysis (exponential, Weibull, Gamma distributions)
- Count data (Poisson regression)
- Binary outcomes with extreme probabilities
- Any model with exponential/log transformations

**Files:**
- `mvn_simulation_stc_analysis.R` - Core MVN simulation functions
- `example_mvn_simulation_stc_analysis.Rmd` & `example_mvn_simulation_stc_analysis.R` - Comprehensive examples
